PLC-based speed control system for two-lane highways, designed to regulate driver speeds and provide real-time visual feedback. The program reads speed data from sensors on the left and right channels, storing it in respective memory locations. For the left channel, it triggers a red alert if speed exceeds 80 km/h (over-speeding), a yellow warning for speeds between 71-79 km/h (high speed), and a green light for speeds under 70 km/h (safe speed). For the right channel, over-speeding is set at 60 km/h, with a warning between 50-59 km/h, and a green light for speeds under 49 km/h. This system helps enforce speed limits and improve road safety by alerting drivers through visualÂ indicators.
